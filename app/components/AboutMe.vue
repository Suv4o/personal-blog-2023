                Hi üëãüèº I'm Aleks Trpkovski, a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with nearly a decade of experience
                building websites and web apps that work well and are easy to use. I've led teams, designed large-scale
                projects, and built AI apps using modern <strong>JavaScript</strong> technologies like
                <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and
                <strong>Python.</strong>

                I‚Äôm always exploring new ways to make websites faster, more intuitive, and user-friendly. With a
                background that spans academic research, startups, and digital agencies, I bring a blend of creative
