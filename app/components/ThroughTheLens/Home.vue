                <strong>Welcome to Through the Lens</strong> — my personal gallery of moments where nature, light, and
                story meet. Here, you’ll find landscapes shaped by towering mountains, endless coastlines, the vibrant
                glow of city nights and the quiet magic of starry skies. Alongside each image, I share gear notes,
                behind-the-scenes stories, and the small details that turned an ordinary scene into something
                unforgettable. Whether you’re here to explore, be inspired, or simply wander through a world of captured
                moments, I’m glad you’ve found your way in.
