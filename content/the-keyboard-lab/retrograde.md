retrogradeTitle: "üïπÔ∏è Retrograde"
retrogradeDescription: "<strong>Retrograde</strong> is a sleek, wireless-capable 65% mechanical keyboard that brings together modern performance with a nostalgic, colorful twist. Built on the Gamakay LK67, this build combines a triple-mode connection (wired, Bluetooth, 2.4GHz) with a tactile media knob and vibrant RGB underglow. Outfitted with lubed Gateron Yellow Milky Pro switches and retro DSA keycaps, every keystroke is smooth, consistent, and full of personality. Extensive internal mods ‚Äî including silicone filling, lubed stabilisers, and a layered tape mod ‚Äî transform the plastic case into a surprisingly deep and refined thock machine. Whether you're gaming, working, or vibing, <strong>Retrograde</strong> is a love letter to the past with the functionality of the future."
