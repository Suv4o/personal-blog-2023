I’ve been meaning to write this blog post for a few years now — I just never got around to it. But here we are. This is the story of how I got into custom mechanical keyboards and how that small curiosity turned into a full-blown obsession.

A few years back, I was bitten by the mechanical keyboard bug. At first, I thought, “**I’ll just buy a pre-built one and be done with it.**” No need to dive deep or spend too much time building one myself, right? Well… that was just the beginning.

My first keyboard came with brown tactile switches. I liked it at first, but as I started exploring the community and learning more, I realised those switches weren’t quite what I was after. So, I tried a new board with red linear switches. And then another one. And then I started swapping keycaps. And experimenting with sound. And trying out different sizes. Before I knew it, I was building and modding keyboards myself — chasing that perfect feel and sound.

In this blog article, I want to share my journey with you and give you a beginner-friendly intro to the world of custom mechanical keyboards. We’ll go over the basics — switches, keycaps, barebones kits, and everything in between. And by the end, we’ll even build a budget-friendly custom keyboard together.

Let’s jump in.

## Choosing the Right Size — What _Feels_ Right?

Before you start shopping for parts, it's good to understand the different keyboard sizes. There’s no “**best**” layout — it really comes down to what fits your workflow and desk space.

Here are the most common options:

![Image of different keyboard sizes](https://res.cloudinary.com/suv4o/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_850,e_sharpen:100/v1745222456/blog/how-i-built-a-budget-friendly-custom-mechanical-keyboard-part-1-the-deep-dive-before-the-build/choosing-the-right-size-what-feels-right_gdemas)

- **Full-size (100%)**: Includes everything — letters, numbers, function row, arrow keys, and a number pad. Classic.
- **Tenkeyless (TKL)**: Drops the number pad, which saves space but keeps the arrows and navigation keys.
- **75%**: Similar to TKL but more compact. Everything’s smushed together a bit, which I personally love.
- **65%**: Ditches the function row but keeps arrows and a few handy keys. A great balance of form and function.
- **60%**: Minimalist vibes. Just the alphas, modifiers, and that's it. You’ll need layers for the rest.
- **40% (and smaller)**: Ultra-compact. These are fun and quirky but come with a learning curve.

If you’re just getting started, I’d suggest trying a **75% or TKL** layout. You get most of the keys without the desk-hogging size of a full layout.

## What Actually Makes a Mechanical Keyboard?

A mechanical keyboard isn’t just about cool keycaps (though they _do_ look awesome). Under the hood, there are a few main components:

![Image of all main components of the keyboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/suv4o/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_850,e_sharpen:100/v1745222720/blog/how-i-built-a-budget-friendly-custom-mechanical-keyboard-part-1-the-deep-dive-before-the-build/what-actually-makes-a-mechanical-keyboard_ewxomd)

- **Keycaps** – What your fingers press. They come in different shapes and materials.
- **Switches** – These sit under the keycaps and decide how your board _feels_ and _sounds_.
- **Plate** – A layer that holds your switches in place. It affects stiffness and acoustics.
- **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)** – The brains. Detects keystrokes and sends them to your computer.
- **Stabilisers (Stabs)** – These go under bigger keys (like spacebar and Enter) to keep them from wobbling.
- **Foam or Dampening Layers** – Optional, but highly recommended. These reduce vibration and improve sound.
- **Case** – Can be plastic (cheap and light), aluminum (solid and premium), or polycarbonate (soft and thocky).
- **Cable** – Usually detachable on customs. Bonus points if it’s coiled ☺️.

> Most people start with a **barebones kit**, which gives you the essentials: case, PCB, plate, and stabilisers. You bring the switches and keycaps to the party.

## Let’s Talk Keycaps — Feel, Sound, and Style

Keycaps might seem like just a cosmetic choice, but they have a big impact on the way your board feels and sounds.

### Profile (aka shape and height)

This is all about how each row is sculpted:

![Image of keycaps profiles](https://res.cloudinary.com/suv4o/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_850,e_sharpen:100/v1745222454/blog/how-i-built-a-budget-friendly-custom-mechanical-keyboard-part-1-the-deep-dive-before-the-build/profile-aka-shape-and-height_pssrng)

- **SA** – Tall, retro-style, and heavily sculpted. They look cool but can take some getting used to.
    - Height: ~16.3 mm
- **OEM** – The standard shape used on most pre-built keyboards. Slightly sculpted and comfortable for general use.
    - _Height_: ~11.9 mm
- **Cherry** – Shorter than OEM, with a smoother curve. Many enthusiasts love this profile for its comfort.
    - _Height_: ~9.4 mm
- **DSA/XDA** – Flat profiles with a uniform height. I personally love these — especially XDA. They’re clean and minimalist.
    - Height: ~7.6 mm (DSA), ~9.1 mm (XDA)

### Material

Two main types here:

- **ABS** – Smooth and light. More prone to shine over time but often more colourful.
- **PBT** – Tougher and more textured. Usually sounds deeper and lasts longer.

> For me, it’s XDA + PBT all day. I just love the feel, and the sound is super satisfying.

## Inside the Switch — What’s Going On Under There?

A switch might be small, but it’s doing a lot. Here’s what’s inside:

![Image of all main components of the switch](https://res.cloudinary.com/suv4o/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_850,e_sharpen:100/v1745222454/blog/how-i-built-a-budget-friendly-custom-mechanical-keyboard-part-1-the-deep-dive-before-the-build/inside-the-switch-whats-going-on-under-there_rsmrpi)

- **Top Housing** – The outer shell that holds it all together.
- **Stem** – The coloured bit that moves up and down when you type.
- **Spring** – Gives the switch resistance and bounce.
- **Bottom Housing** – Connects the switch to your PCB.

Simple enough, right? But small design changes can totally change how a switch feels.

## Switch Types — Linear, Tactile, or Clicky?

When people talk switches, they usually mean one of these three:

- **Linear** – Smooth from top to bottom. No bump, no click. Great for fast typing and gaming.
    - _Most popular_: Gateron Red, Cherry MX Red, Kailh Red
- **Tactile** – Has a little bump mid-press that lets you know the key’s registered.
    - _Most popular_: Gateron Brown, Cherry MX Brown, Zealios V2
- **Clicky** – Like tactile, but louder. Click sound and all.
    - _Most popular_: Gateron Blue, Cherry MX Blue, Kailh Box White

> I started on tactiles, but eventually I fell in love with linears. There’s something super buttery about them — especially when lubed.

## Understanding Switch Force

When exploring mechanical switches, you'll see measurements like **45g** or **62g**. That "g" stands for **grams of actuation force** — the pressure needed to register a keystroke.

Here's what different actuation forces feel like:

- **< 45g – Ultra-Light:** Feather-light touch. Perfect for fast typing but might cause accidental keypresses.
- **45–55g – Light:** Smooth and effortless. Most popular for beginners and everyday typing.
- **55–65g – Medium:** Balanced resistance. Offers precise control without finger fatigue.
- **65g+ – Heavy:** Firm resistance. Great for heavy-handed typists who want to prevent misclicks.

> For beginners, I suggest switches in the 45-55g range. This sweet spot lets you comfortably develop your typing style.

> Everyone has a preference — and trying different switches is part of the fun. If possible, grab a switch tester (there are plenty available to order from various manufacturers) or use a hot-swappable keyboard to experiment. Feeling the differences firsthand is the best way to figure out what suits your typing style.

## Let’s Talk Sound — What is a “Thocky” Keyboard?

Ah yes — the famous thock. If you hang around keyboard nerds long enough, you’ll hear a lot of sound talk.

- Thock – Deep, satisfying, and soft. The holy grail.
- Clack – Sharper and brighter. Think crisp clicks.
- Hollow – That cheap, echoey sound you don’t want.

What affects sound?

- Switch type – Linears are usually quieter. Clickies are loud and proud.
- Keycaps – PBT tends to sound deeper.
- Case material – Aluminum sounds solid; plastic is lighter and often more hollow.
- Mods – Adding foam, lubing switches, taping the PCB — these can transform your board.

The fun part? You can experiment endlessly until it sounds just right.

## **Ready to Build Your First Budget Custom Keyboard?**
