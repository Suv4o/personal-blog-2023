# Evening View of Melbourne CBD

Just by the Yarra River, looking out toward the Swan Street Bridge and Melbourne’s CBD, I wanted to try something different from my usual wide-angle cityscapes. The sky was perfectly clear, so I waited for blue hour when the city lights began to shine against the dusk. Instead of reaching for my 17mm, I switched to a 50mm on my Nikon D800 and created a three-frame vertical panorama. A nearby tree caught my eye, and I used its branches to frame the skyline, giving the shot more focus and character. Without any filters, the simple compression of the 50mm panorama brought out a fresh perspective of Melbourne’s city glow.
