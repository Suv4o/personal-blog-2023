# The Lego House of Melbourne

Just near Albert Park sits a building that locals often call “the Lego House”, its blocky shapes and playful colors look like they’ve been pieced together from giant toy bricks. I had passed it many times, always thinking I’d come back with my camera one day. That chance finally came when a friend and I set out to photograph it, braving a dash across the road to a small island where we could line up the perfect composition. With my Nikon D800 and a 17–35mm lens fitted with a circular polariser and 10-stop ND filter, I captured a long exposure that blended car trails below with the almost cartoon-like facade above. It felt like freezing a little slice of imagination in the middle of Melbourne.
