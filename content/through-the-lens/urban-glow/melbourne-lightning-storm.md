# Lightning Over Melbourne’s Skyline

Brighton Beach in Melbourne is known for its colourful bathing boxes and sweeping city views, but on this particular evening, the sky had other plans. I originally set out to capture the sunset from the Brighton Beach Gardens viewpoint, where the skyline sits perfectly on the horizon. As the sun dipped lower, a storm began rolling in behind the city, far enough away that I couldn’t hear a sound, but close enough to watch lightning streak across the clouds as if striking the skyscrapers themselves. The air was calm, warm, and still, giving me the rare chance to set up my Nikon D5200 with a Sigma 50–150mm lens and shoot long exposures without battling wind or rain. Frame by frame, I captured the storm’s dramatic display, and one of those exposures became this image, a black-and-white composition that has since gone on to win awards and be featured in several magazines.
