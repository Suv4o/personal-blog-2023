# Urban Glow from William Barak Bridge

Standing on the William Barak Bridge, I watched Melbourne’s skyline transform as the city shifted from work to play. Along Batman Avenue, the steady flow of cars turned into glowing light trails, weaving through the scene as office towers lit up the evening sky. I wanted to capture that balance of movement and stillness, so I reached for my Nikon D7200 with the Sigma 18–35mm and added a 6-stop ND filter. The longer exposure softened the clouds while stretching the car lights into vibrant streaks, giving the city an energy you could almost feel.
