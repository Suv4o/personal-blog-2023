# Autumn Glow by the Yarra

Melbourne in autumn has a special charm, especially near the Yarra River where the trees slowly turn golden. On this day, the rain had just stopped, leaving the pavements wet and glistening with scattered leaves all around. The city felt unusually quiet, with hardly anyone around, and I wasn’t expecting much of a sunset because of the thick clouds. But just as the day closed, a shy orange glow broke through, perfectly echoing the warm tones of the autumn leaves. I captured the moment with my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, drawn to how the scene balanced both the stillness of the rain and the soft light that matched the season’s spirit.
