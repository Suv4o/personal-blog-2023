# Perth Skyline Panorama from South Perth Jetty

The South Perth Fishing Jetty offers one of the best views of the Perth skyline, but when I first set up my camera, I realised the usual angle lacked a strong subject. Instead of settling for a standard shot, I decided to experiment by creating a long vertical panorama that stretched across the cityscape. Using my Nikon D7200 paired with a Sigma 18–35mm lens, I captured six vertical portrait images with the help of an ND filter, each taken minutes apart as the light shifted quickly. Blending them together was tricky, the fading light meant I had to manually balance exposures, but in the end, the result felt like something truly unique. It’s a view I don’t think many have captured from this spot before.
