# Calm Waters, Bright City

Standing by the Yarra River opposite the Melbourne Exhibition Centre, I wanted to capture the city as the calm evening shifted into night. This was one of my first outings with my brand-new Nikon D800 paired with the Nikon 17–35mm, and I decided to experiment with a stitched panorama of three vertical shots at 17mm. With no clouds in the sky and the water still, I framed the bridge to the right so it could guide the eye into Melbourne’s glowing buildings. The contrast between the cool blue of the hour and the warm golden city lights gave the photo a cinematic feel, like a scene pulled straight from a film.
