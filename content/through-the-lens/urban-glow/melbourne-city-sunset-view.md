# The Most Romantic Sunset Spot in Melbourne

Tucked away along Yarra Boulevard in Kew sits one of Melbourne’s most romantic hidden gems, a quiet spot with a single bench overlooking the city skyline. It’s the kind of place where you feel like the whole of Melbourne is yours, especially as the sun dips behind the horizon and the lights of the CBD begin to sparkle. I couldn’t resist setting up my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm lens on a tripod, capturing a series of wide shots that I later stitched together in Adobe Lightroom. The result is this dreamy sunset view, framed by trees and bathed in golden light, a moment that felt just as magical in person as it does in the photo.
