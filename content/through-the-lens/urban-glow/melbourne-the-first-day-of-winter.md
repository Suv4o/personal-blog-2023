# Melbourne Skyline on the First Day of Winter

The Melbourne skyline on the very first day of winter. This was the building where I used to work, with a full 360° view of the city, so I stayed a little longer after work to capture the sunset. The timing was perfect, blue hour had just set in, the lights across the buildings began to glow, and the city came alive. I used my Nikon D800 with a 24-70mm lens at 35mm, along with a polarising filter to cut reflections, which really helped the lights stand out against the fading sky.
