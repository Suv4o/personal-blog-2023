# Winter Glow Over Bitola

From the Forty Holy Martyrs Church at Krkardash, the snowy hills above Bitola open into one of the most magical views of my hometown. That evening, a close friend and I climbed up from the neighborhood of Bair, wrapped in warm clothes against the cold. The city slowly lit up beneath us as the sun dipped below the horizon, filling the scene with golden tones and cool blue shadows that felt almost like a scene from a movie. I wanted to capture both the church in the corner and the city’s winter glow, so I used my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm, stitching together a 12-image panorama to hold onto that quiet, glowing moment.
