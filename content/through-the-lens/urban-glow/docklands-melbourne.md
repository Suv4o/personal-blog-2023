# Docklands, Wide and Bright

Docklands in Melbourne has always had a modern, urban glow, and this photo takes me back to when I was just starting out in photography. I shot it with my old Nikon D5200 and a Sigma 12–24mm wide-angle lens, playing with HDR for the first time. I remember carefully bracketing five exposures, running them through Photomatix, and feeling amazed at how much detail I could bring out. The scene itself was simple, no dramatic skies, no heavy clouds — but it became one of the first images I really felt proud of. I re-edited it countless times, learning something new each attempt, and it still reminds me of those early days of discovery.
