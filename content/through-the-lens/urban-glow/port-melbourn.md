# Pink Dawn at Port Melbourne

Sandridge Lookout gives a sweeping view across Port Melbourne, and this photo holds a special memory for me. Taken in between Melbourne’s long COVID lockdowns, when restrictions briefly eased, my wife and I made the most of our chance to venture beyond the 5km limit. I set up my Nikon D800 with a 70–200mm lens on the tripod, adding a circular polariser and a 6-stop ND filter to shape the light. A lone rock in the bay became my foreground anchor, balancing the composition as the first rays of sunrise lit up fast-moving clouds in soft pink over the city. It was a fleeting moment of beauty and freedom I felt grateful to capture.
