# A Summer Evening in Melbourne

Melbourne’s CBD always carries a unique energy, and on this summer evening along the Yarra River, I wanted to capture the city’s glow just before blue hour. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, I set up using a polarising filter and my brand-new NiSi filters kit. Unfortunately, it was also the day I accidentally smashed my very first ND graduated filter, the holder slipped and it hit the concrete. Even though the sky was clear without clouds, the mix of fading sunlight and soft purple-blue tones made this shot worth remembering. The location itself has since changed, with the river path replaced by an elevated one, so this exact view can’t be recreated, making the photo even more special to me.
