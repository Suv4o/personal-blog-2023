# Golden Hour Over Docklands

<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eb6k1WHeUvfeoXBP6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Google Maps</a>

From the rooftop of a tucked-away parking lot in Melbourne, I found one of those hidden 360° views that photographers love. Facing the Docklands, I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm wide open at 17mm, stacking a 10-stop ND filter with a circular polariser. The filters let me slow the shutter, catching the flow of car trails along Docklands Highway while softening reflections. Shooting at golden hour made the city glow, and the leading lines naturally pulled my eye straight into the skyline. It felt like capturing a secret slice of Melbourne from above.
