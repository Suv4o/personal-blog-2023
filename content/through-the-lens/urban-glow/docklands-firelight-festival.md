# Sunset Glow at Docklands

Docklands in Melbourne is best known for its modern skyline and lively events, but that evening I arrived ahead of the Firelight Festival to catch the sunset. I framed the shot with the old dock pillars in the foreground, now serving as reminders of the area’s history, and used my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm lens wide at 17mm. A 10-stop ND filter smoothed the water, while a polariser cut through reflections. I waited patiently until the city lights came on, adding depth against the colourful sky that unfolded, a stroke of luck that made the scene feel almost cinematic. After this photo, I joined the festival for good food, music, and a fitting celebration.
