# Melbourne’s New Year’s Eve Glow from Brighton Beach

From Brighton’s Green Point City View, you get one of the best panoramic looks at Melbourne’s skyline, and on New Year’s Eve, it’s pure magic. My partner and I weren’t sure how to celebrate, but with clear skies promised, we packed some food, drinks, and picnic chairs, and headed down to the beach just after sunset to claim a good spot. The crowd was buzzing, families and friends all waiting for the sky to light up. I set up my Nikon D800 with a 70–200mm lens, zoomed all the way in at 200mm, and waited for midnight. When the fireworks finally burst over the CBD, this was the shot that captured the glow and excitement of the night best.
