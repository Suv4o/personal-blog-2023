# A Christmas Sunset Over Melbourne CBD

From the balcony of Hamer Hall, you get one of Melbourne’s most underrated views of the city. It’s a public spot where anyone can step out, sit on the benches, and take in the skyline as the Yarra glides past below. I went there during the Christmas holidays with the hope of capturing the city from above, and the timing was just right, sunset cast a golden glow across the buildings, while the Princes Bridge, lit with a festive “Merry Christmas” sign, guided the eye straight into the heart of the CBD. This shot came together naturally, without the use of filters, using my Nikon D7200 paired with a Sigma 18–35mm lens.
