# Golden Hour at The Pinnacles

The Pinnacles Lookout on Cape Woolamai is one of Phillip Island’s most breathtaking spots, where rugged sea cliffs and dramatic rock formations rise straight from the ocean. My wife and I hiked from Cape Woolamai Surf Beach, a moderate 45-minute trail that first takes you across the sand and then along the cliffs with sweeping coastal views. By the time we reached the lookout, the wind was strong as always, but the golden hour light was worth every step. I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm f/2.8 on a tripod, waiting as the sun dipped lower, painting the scene in warm tones that felt like something out of The Lord of the Rings. It was one of those moments where nature does all the work, you just have to be there to capture it.
