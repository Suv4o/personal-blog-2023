# Where Cliffs Meet the Horizon

The George Bass Coastal Walk in Victoria is a rugged stretch of coastline where the cliffs meet the endless horizon, and the ocean seems to roll forever. About halfway along, overlooking Half Moon Bay, I set up my Nikon D800 with the 24–70mm lens zoomed in, hoping for a dramatic sunset sky. At first, the evening looked too calm, but then thick clouds began racing across the horizon just as the sun dipped behind me, casting a warm glow onto the cliffs. I added a polarizing filter to cut the glare and a 10-stop ND filter to stretch the clouds into motion, bringing depth and movement to the scene. The result was an image that captured both the stillness of the cliffs and the fleeting energy of the sky.
