# Golden Hour at Pillar Point Lookout

Pillar Point Lookout in Wilsons Promontory is one of those spots that makes you stop and take it all in, with sweeping views of Mount Oberon, Squeaky Beach, and the vast open ocean. On a hike we hadn’t done before, we arrived just before sunset, when the golden light washed across the coastline. Perched on the huge granite rocks, I searched for the right composition, torn between so many breathtaking directions. In the end, I settled my Nikon D800 with a 70–200mm lens at 135mm, added a circular polariser and a 6-stop ND filter to smooth the water and blur the moving clouds, and framed Norman Island as the main subject. The way the sun reflected off the ocean around that small rocky island felt like the perfect balance between serenity and drama.
