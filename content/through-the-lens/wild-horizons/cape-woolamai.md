# The Cliffs of Cape Woolamai

Cape Woolamai on Phillip Island is famous for its rugged cliffs and sweeping ocean views, a place where the coastline feels raw and untamed. My partner and I had set out for the Pinnacle Lookout, but curiosity pulled me further toward the lighthouse. Along the track, I stopped at a small bay framed by towering cliffs, a spot I’d photographed before, so I immediately knew the composition I wanted. With my Nikon D800 and 24–70mm lens set around 50mm, I added a NiSi polariser to enrich the sky and water, and a 10-stop ND filter to capture the drifting motion of the clouds. The sun was behind me, but the bouncing light added subtle colours to the sky, making the scene come alive in a way that felt both familiar and fresh.
