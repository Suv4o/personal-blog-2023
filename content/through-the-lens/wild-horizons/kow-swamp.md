# Reflections at Kow Swamp

Kow Swamp, tucked away in northern Victoria, is a place I stumbled upon almost by accident. I had spent the day in Bendigo looking for compositions but came up empty, so I turned to Google Maps in search of something nearby. Thatâ€™s how I found myself driving two hours north for sunset, arriving just in time to discover the calm waters and eerie beauty of the leafless trees rising from the swamp. The stillness of the water created perfect mirror-like reflections, and I knew I had found something special. I shot this scene as an 18-image panorama using my Nikon D5200 with a 50mm 1.8 G lens, later stitching it together
