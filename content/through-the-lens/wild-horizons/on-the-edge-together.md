# On the Edge Together at Whisky Bay

Whisky Bay in Wilsons Promontory is one of those hidden gems where golden sand meets turquoise waters, framed by rugged cliffs and untamed ocean. During a trip with my partner, long before we were married, we spent a few days hiking and exploring while staying in the nearby town of Foster. One evening at sunset we visited Whisky Bay, I set up my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens and a NiSi circular polarizing filter to cut the reflections and deepen the colours in the sky. The scene felt a little empty, so I set the camera to auto-shoot and we carefully stood hand in hand on the edge of the cliff, bracing against the wind and the crash of waves below. Staying perfectly still wasn’t easy, but the result was a photo that turned a sweeping coastal view into a moment of personal connection.
