# Standing Above the Coastline – George Bass Coastal Walk

The George Bass Coastal Walk in Victoria is a rugged trail with sweeping views of the cliffs and coastline near Phillip Island. My wife and I set out for a hike, and as always, I brought along my Nikon D800 with the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens—just in case the trail revealed something special. When we reached the highest point, the view was breathtaking: the coastline twisted like a serpent beneath us. I quickly set up my tripod, added a NiSi polariser and a graduated filter to bring out the sky, and framed the shot at around 35mm. At first, the scene felt incomplete, so I asked my wife to step into the frame, and then joined her. Together we created this memorable image, an intimate perspective against the vast coastal backdrop.
