# Lonely Tree on the Horizon

Somewhere between Melbourne and Bendigo, I came across this lone tree perched on a hill, glowing softly as the sun dipped behind it. It was one of those unplanned moments, you’re just driving home, spot something striking, and can’t resist pulling over. With my Nikon D5200 paired with the Sigma 50-150mm f/2.8, I zoomed right in to compress the scene, letting the golden light shape the sky while the hill and tree fell into silhouette. The curve of the hill added just the right balance, making the stillness of this solitary tree feel even more powerful.
