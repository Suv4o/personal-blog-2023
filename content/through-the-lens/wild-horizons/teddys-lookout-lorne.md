# Great Ocean Road in Motion

Teddy’s Lookout in Lorne is one of the most iconic spots along the Great Ocean Road, perched high above where the mountains meet the winding coastline. I arrived on a summer afternoon after driving down from Melbourne, ending the day at this spectacular viewpoint. The weather kept shifting, clear skies gave way to strong winds and heavy clouds as sunset approached, but just before blue hour, a small gap in the horizon let the sun break through, painting the scene with fleeting colors. I stayed through twilight to capture the car trails along the road below, adding motion and perspective to the darkened mountains. Shot with my Nikon D7200 and Sigma 18–35mm lens, I stitched together three portrait frames into a panorama that brought the full drama of this moment to life.
