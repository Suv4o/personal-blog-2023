# Stormy Skies Over Teddy’s Lookout

Teddy’s Lookout in Lorne is known for its sweeping views of the Great Ocean Road, but on this visit the sunset I’d hoped for never arrived. Instead, I was met with heavy clouds, strong winds, and a moody atmosphere that perfectly mirrored what I was going through at the time. Rather than fight the conditions, I leaned into them, using my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm f/2.8 lens, along with a NiSi polarizing filter and a 10-stop ND filter. The long exposure stretched the clouds into streaks and caught the headlights snaking along the Great Ocean Road below, turning what was meant to be a colourful sunset into a dramatic, almost cinematic scene.
