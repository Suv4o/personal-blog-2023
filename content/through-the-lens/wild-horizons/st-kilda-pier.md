# The Lost View of St Kilda Pier

St Kilda Pier in Melbourne has always been a spot where the city meets the sea, with fishermen, locals, and travelers drawn to its charm. Back in 2016, I captured this panorama while sitting on the rocks where fishermen often cast their lines, rocks that are now hidden beneath the new pier. The old wooden structure has since been demolished, making this exact view impossible to recreate. Using my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18-35mm lens, I stitched together three vertical frames into one wide composition. The low light gave me the chance to use a long exposure, softening the sky’s movement and preserving a moment of the pier’s history that now only exists in photographs like this one.
