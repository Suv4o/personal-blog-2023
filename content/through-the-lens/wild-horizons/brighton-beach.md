# Brighton Bathing Boxes in Motion

Brighton Beach in Melbourne is best known for its colourful Bathing Boxes, a spot that draws countless tourists every day. While most people photograph them from the front, I wanted something different, so I set up behind the boxes to capture a unique perspective. Using my Nikon D800 with a 17-35mm f/2.8 lens, I mounted the camera on a tripod, added a 10-stop NiSi ND filter and a polarizing filter, and went for a long exposure. The result not only softened the movement of the clouds but also magically erased the crowds walking by, leaving the vibrant colors of the boxes to shine against the dynamic sky.
