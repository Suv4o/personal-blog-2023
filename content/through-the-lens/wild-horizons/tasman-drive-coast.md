# A Hidden Sunset on Tasman Drive Coast

The Tasman Drive Coast is one of those places you stumble upon by pure chance, and that’s exactly what happened here. My wife and I were out exploring the Mornington Peninsula one Saturday, following our weekend tradition of finding new walks and hidden corners. I spotted a coastal trail on Google Maps, and we decided to check it out. At first, I left my camera in the car, but as soon as I saw this view with the bay opening into the horizon under the soft glow of sunset, I knew we had to go back. I grabbed my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm f/2.8, set it up behind a bush for some foreground texture, and captured this scene. It was an unexpected discovery that turned into one of my favorite coastal shots.
