# The Hidden Jetty at Shelly Beach

Shelly Beach in Portsea, Victoria, is one of those quiet coastal spots that locals cherish but many visitors overlook. I’ve spent countless days here, sometimes just swimming in the calm waters, other times chasing the perfect photograph of its picturesque jetties. On this winter day, I set up my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens at 17mm, using a tripod, a 6-stop ND filter, and a polariser to smooth out the waves and cut reflections. The weather kept shifting between rain and sunshine, and I found myself constantly wiping raindrops from the lens, rain jacket pulled tight, waiting for the moment. Suddenly, the clouds broke, sunlight spilled across the water, and the private jetty framed the scene perfectly, leading the eye straight to the boathouse. After many attempts over the years, this shot has become my favourite from Shelly Beach. That patience pays off.
