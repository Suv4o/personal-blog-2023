# Sunset Dreams from Mount Oberon Summit

Perched high above Wilsons Promontory, Mount Oberon Summit offers one of the most breathtaking views in Victoria. The climb is steep, especially the final scramble over large rocks, but once you reach the top you feel transported to another world. When my partner and I finally made it to the top, we found a few people already gathered, quietly waiting for the sun to set. I set up my Nikon D800 with a 17-35mm f/2.8 lens, using a circular NiSi polariser and a 6-stop ND filter to capture a long exposure. The result was exactly what I hoped for, a photograph where the sky glowed and the landscape felt alive with movement. Watching the sunset from that height, with the sea and mountains stretching endlessly, was nothing short of magical.
