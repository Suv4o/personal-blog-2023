# Golden Fields of San Remo

San Remo, a charming coastal town just before Phillip Island in Victoria, is best known for its seaside views, but I stumbled upon a different scene that caught my eye. Driving without a plan, I came across a freshly harvested field with golden hay bales lined up against a blue sky. Luckily, I had my Nikon D800 in the car, so I set up my tripod, zoomed in with my 24–70mm lens at 70mm, added a polariser and a 6-stop ND filter, and captured this unexpected composition. It was one of those spontaneous moments before sunset that reminded me why I love carrying my camera everywhere.
