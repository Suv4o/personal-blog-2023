# Through the Clouds - Stirling Range

The Stirling Range National Park in Western Australia is famous for its rugged peaks and sweeping landscapes. On my trip from Perth, a four and a half hour drive through the countryside, I was drawn to this area where the distant mountains seemed to stretch endlessly. I explored a few lookouts, but it was the Western Lookout that truly captured my attention. From this vantage point, the peaks layered beneath shifting clouds created a dramatic scene. I set up my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 50–150mm f/1.8 lens, zooming in to about 150mm (equivalent to 200mm on a crop sensor) and waited as the sun peeked through gaps in the clouds. The interplay of light and shadow gave the landscape a dynamic feel. To avoid blur at this focal length, I had to increase the ISO slightly, which added a subtle grain that only enhanced the moody, raw feel of the image.
