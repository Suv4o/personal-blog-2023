# Sunset at Shelley Beach Jetty

Shelley Beach in Portsea, Victoria, hides a series of charming jetties, each offering a unique perspective. This particular wooden jetty caught my eye repeatedly, its zig-zag shape adding a striking compositional element. The sun was behind me, but the clouds lit up beautifully from the bouncing light, creating vivid colours I had been chasing for years. I used my Nikon D800 with the 17â€“35mm lens, paired with a circular polariser and a 6-stop ND filter, to smooth the water and enhance the colours while emphasizing the movement in the clouds. The patience finally paid off, and the scene unfolded exactly as I had hoped
