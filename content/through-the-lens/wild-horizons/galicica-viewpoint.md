# Blue Hour Over Trpejca from Koritski Rid at Galicica National Park

High above Lake Ohrid, Koritski Rid in Galicica National Park offers one of the most breathtaking vantage points in North Macedonia. From this lookout, the entire lake stretches out beneath you, with the charming village of Trpejca framed perfectly to the left. On this visit, I waited patiently for blue hour, the moment when the fading daylight meets the first village lights, to capture both the glow of Trpejca and the winding road below, alive with car trails. The sky was clear but hazy with dust, softening the sun’s rays, which added a dreamlike quality to the scene. With my Nikon D800 and a Nikon 17–35mm lens, I was able to bring together the wide expanse of the lake, the mountains beyond, and the quiet magic of the evening light.
