# Stormy Horizons at Cape Woolamai

Cape Woolamai Walk on Phillip Island is known for its dramatic cliffs, rugged coastline, and sweeping ocean views. My partner and I originally set out for the famous Pinnacle Lookout, but halfway through the hike I decided to wander further toward the lighthouse in search of a fresh perspective. Along the track, I came across a small bay framed by windswept bushes and towering cliffs, and it immediately struck me as the perfect composition. Using my Nikon D800 with the 17â€“35mm f/2.8, I added a NiSi polariser to deepen the colours and cut reflections, and a 6-stop ND filter to draw out the motion in the moody sky. The weather had shifted quickly from clear blue to stormy gray, and that sudden change brought exactly the kind of atmosphere I was hoping to capture.
