# Golden Light on the George Bass Coast

The George Bass Coastal Walk in Victoria is one of those places that feels endless, with rugged cliffs, rolling waves, and open skies stretching as far as you can see. About halfway along the track, overlooking Half Moon Bay, I set up my Nikon D800 with the 24–70mm lens zoomed all the way in. I had hoped for dramatic clouds at sunset, but the sky stayed clear. Still, the fading light painted the coastline in warm golden tones, and I found myself drawn to the simplicity of that moment. With other people enjoying the trail, it felt like a reminder that sometimes the quiet, uncomplicated scenes are just as worth capturing.
