# Lost in the Perry Sandhills

Just outside Mildura in northwest Victoria lies the Perry Sandhills, a striking pocket of desert that feels worlds away from the city. On a road trip with my partner and our little shih-tzu April in a camper van, we stopped here at sunset to take in the rolling dunes. I noticed a few bushes scattered in the sand and framed them in the foreground, then asked my partner and April to walk to the top of the hill for scale. I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm f/2.8 on interval shooting and ran to join them, leaving the camera to capture the moment. If you look closely, you might just spot the three of us in the distance, dwarfed by the vastness of the sandhills.
