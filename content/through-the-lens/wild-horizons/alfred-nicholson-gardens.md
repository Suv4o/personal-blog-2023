# Autumn Reds at Alfred Nicholas Gardens

Nestled in the Dandenong Ranges, the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Garden is a favourite spot in Victoria when autumn transforms its paths into a tapestry of red, yellow, and gold. On my visit, one fiery red tree immediately stood out, and with my own red jacket, I knew I had the perfect chance to create a photo with both scale and story. I set up my Nikon D800 with the 24–70mm lens at 70mm on a tripod, choosing a portrait composition to emphasize the tree’s size. To bring out the richness of the leaves, I used a NiSi polarizing filter, cutting through reflections and making the colors pop. It felt like I arrived at just the right moment. Only a week later, and this burst of color would have been gone.
