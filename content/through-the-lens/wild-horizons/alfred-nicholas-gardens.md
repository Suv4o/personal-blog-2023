# Autumn Reflections at Alfred Nicholas Gardens

Nestled in the Dandenong Ranges, the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Garden is a place where every corner feels like a painting. At the bottom of the park lies a serene lake with a charming wooden boathouse, a favourite subject for photographers. I captured this scene in autumn, when the trees transformed into a tapestry of reds, yellows, and browns, their colours mirrored perfectly on the still water. Using my Nikon D800 paired with a 50mm 1.8 G lens, I tried to preserve that fleeting moment when the garden feels most magical-calm, colourful, and timeless.
