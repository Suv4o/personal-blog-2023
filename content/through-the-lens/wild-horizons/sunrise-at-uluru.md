# Sunrise Fire Over Uluru

Uluru, the sacred heart of Australia’s Red Centre, is often imagined under endless blue skies and blazing sun, but on this morning I witnessed something rare. Rain had passed through the desert overnight, and clouds lingered as I drove out before dawn, expecting only a moody, overcast scene. Instead, the sky erupted in fiery colours that lit up the sandstone monolith like it was alive. I set up my tripod, framed the scene with the small desert shrubs in the foreground, and stitched together a panorama of three vertical shots using my Nikon D7200 and Sigma 18–35mm f/1.8. The result was a once-in-a-lifetime sunrise.
