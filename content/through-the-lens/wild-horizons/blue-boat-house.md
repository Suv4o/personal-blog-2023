# Blue Hour at the Blue Boat House

The Blue Boat House in Perth, Western Australia, is one of the city’s most photographed spots, sitting quietly over the Swan River. When I arrived, it was crowded with tourists taking selfies, so I knew a simple snapshot wouldn’t capture the calm mood I wanted. I set up my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm f1.8 and a 10-stop ND filter for a long exposure, which magically smoothed the water and erased the crowds. Waiting for blue hour paid off, without clouds in the sky, the pastel tones created exactly the serene image I had hoped for.
