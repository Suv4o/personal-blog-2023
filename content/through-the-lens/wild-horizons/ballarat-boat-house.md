# Vintage Boat House at Lake Wendouree

Lake Wendouree in Ballarat, Victoria, is a place where locals gather for sailing, picnics, and long walks along its scenic trail. Among the many boat houses that line the shore, each with its own character, this red and yellow vintage one instantly caught my eye. I had planned the shoot in advance, hoping the weather would hold, and was rewarded with calm waters and just enough soft light to bring out the tones I wanted. Captured with my Nikon D800 and a 17â€“35mm lens, the stillness of the lake gave the scene a timeless, peaceful feel that made the moment worth waiting for.
