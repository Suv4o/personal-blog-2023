# Whisky Bay Sunset at Wilsons Promontory

Whisky Bay in Wilsons Promontory National Park is one of those places where time slows down, light golden sand, turquoise water, and rocky headlands on either side framing the view. I wanted to capture the beauty of Norman Island sitting just offshore, with its rugged twin peaks rising like a small mountain in the distance. To create the composition, I used the rocks on the left as natural leading lines guiding the eye toward the island, while a long exposure softened the waves and let the reflections glow across the wet sand. I was lucky with the sunset that evening, as the sky erupted in colour and mirrored beautifully in the water. This shot was taken with my Nikon D7200 and a Sigma 18–35mm lens.
