# Endless Horizons at Mundi Mundi Lookout

Just outside the outback town of Broken Hill lies the famous Mundi Mundi Lookout, where the land suddenly opens into an endless desert plain. Standing here at sunset, I felt a mix of awe and insignificance as the horizon stretched so far you could almost see the curve of the earth. I stitched together ten shots with my Nikon D5200 and trusty 50mm lens to create this panorama, using the winding road as a leading line into the vastness. The challenge was balancing the golden rays breaking through a gap on the horizon with the sheer scale of the scene. That’s exactly what made this photo worth capturing.
