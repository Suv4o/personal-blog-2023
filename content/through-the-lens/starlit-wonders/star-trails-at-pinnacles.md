# Chasing Star Trails at the Pinnacles

In 2017, I found myself in the otherworldly Pinnacles Desert of Western Australia, where limestone spires rise like sculptures from the sand. I arrived just before sunset, grabbed a few glowing shots, and then waited as the crowds disappeared and the sky turned into a blanket of stars. With the PhotoPills app, I lined up the southern sky behind one of the pinnacles and shot hundreds of frames using my Nikon D7200 and Sigma 18–35mm f/1.8. To keep the rock from blending into the shadows, I used my car’s headlights for a soft touch of light. Back home, I stacked the images in StarStax, and the result was a swirl of star trails wrapping the desert in magic.
