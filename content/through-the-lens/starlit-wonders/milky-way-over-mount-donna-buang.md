# Milky Way at Mount Donna Buang

Mount Donna Buang, tucked away in the Yarra Ranges National Park, is one of those places where the stars feel almost within reach. One warm February night, I went there with four friends to capture the Milky Way, only to find other photographers gathered with the same idea. At first, we climbed the famous lookout tower for a clear view, but I soon realised the best composition was from the ground, where the tower’s silhouette framed against the night sky alongside the trees and bushes. Using my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm f/1.8, I stitched together a 10-image panorama to bring the scene to life. We stayed through the night, watching the stars fade as the sun rose, a reminder of how magical it feels to witness the sky transform.
