# Aurora Dreams at Teddy’s Lookout

Teddy’s Lookout in Lorne is one of the most breathtaking vantage points along the Great Ocean Road, offering sweeping views of winding roads and rugged coastline. In May 2024, I got an alert that the Aurora Australis would reach unusually high visibility, and I knew this was the chance to capture something special. My wife and I packed up and drove out late that Saturday night, chasing the southern lights. When we arrived, the lookout was overflowing with people, almost like a pop-up outdoor cinema, with chairs, snacks, and groups watching the aurora dance above. Knowing the spot well from previous sunset shoots, I slipped away to the lower viewpoint, where darkness kept most visitors away. Suddenly it was just me, my wife, my Nikon D800 with a 17–55mm f/2.8, and the aurora blazing above the silent coastline. Shooting in that peaceful solitude, I felt like the world had paused, leaving only the glow of the sky and the road below.
