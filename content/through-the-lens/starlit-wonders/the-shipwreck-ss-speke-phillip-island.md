# Stars Over the SS Speke

The SS Speke shipwreck at Kitty Miller Bay on Phillip Island is a hauntingly beautiful sight, especially when night falls. Me and my two friends made the trek along the rocky coastline, carefully navigating the uneven ground and steep descent before reaching the wreck at low tide. The sky was restless with fast-moving clouds, but that only added to the drama. Using my Nikon D7200 paired with a fisheye lens, I was able to capture the wreck and the sky in a way that felt almost surreal, the wide curve of the lens pulling the scene together into a single sweeping frame. The mix of clouds and stars gave the photo an atmosphere I couldnâ€™t have planned, reminding me that sometimes the weather makes the story.
