# Star Trails Above the Pinnacles

Pinnacles Lookout on Phillip Island is one of those places that feels untouched and wild, with its rugged cliffs and sweeping ocean views. On a freezing August night, a friend and I made the 45-minute trek from Woolamai Beach, walking along the sand before climbing the stairs that wind up the coastal cliffs. The winds were fierce, and I was grateful for my jacket, but the view was worth every step. I shot the scene with my Nikon D800 and 17-35mm f/2.8, starting at golden hour to capture the fading sunset, then blending dozens of exposures through Photoshop, Lightroom, and StarStax to reveal the star trails above the Pinnacles. Despite the cold, standing under that clear sky made the whole experience unforgettable.
