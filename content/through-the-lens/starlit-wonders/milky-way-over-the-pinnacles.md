# Chasing the Milky Way at Pinnacles Lookout

Pinnacles Lookout on Phillip Island is already stunning at sunset, but the real magic happens after dark. My friend and I originally went there to catch the sunset, but with the forecast promising clear skies and no moon, we decided to stay longer and try for the Milky Way. Using the PhotoPills app on my phone, I planned the timing and angle, knowing the core would rise perfectly above the horizon in October. Getting closer to the Pinnacles required a steep and tricky descent, one that’s definitely not recommended alone or in the dark, especially with the tide creeping in. With headlamps and a bit of caution, we made it down and met a few other photographers who had the same idea. I used my Nikon D800 with a 17-55mm f/2.8 to shoot a 12-image panorama, each with a 30-second exposure. Later, I stitched them together in Lightroom, and the result was this beautiful capture of the Milky Way arching over the Pinnacles. A night I’ll never forget.
