# Aurora at Split Point Lighthouse

In May 2024, my phone buzzed with an alert from my aurora app. The index was predicted to be very high that night. My wife and I quickly packed up and drove along the Great Ocean Road, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Aurora Australis. By the time we reached Split Point Lighthouse, the skies were clear and full of promise. And then it happened, the horizon burst into red and green light, dancing above us. Families and photographers gathered around, all quietly amazed by the beauty. Using my Nikon D800 with a 17-55mm lens and a NiSi polarising filter, I captured this shot, the last one of the night. It’s a moment I’ll never forget, and I’m not sure I’ll ever see the aurora this bright again.
