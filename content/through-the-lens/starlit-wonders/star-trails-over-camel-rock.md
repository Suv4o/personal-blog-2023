# Starlit New Year’s Eve at Camel Rock

On New Year’s Eve 2021, while camping nearby for the holidays, I decided to skip the fireworks and spend the evening with the stars instead. I set up my Nikon D800 with a 70–200mm f/2.8 lens, zoomed all the way to 200mm, to compress the scene and capture the full silhouette of the rock. Over the course of a couple of hours, I blended hundreds of exposures into this starlit trail across the sky, a patient process that was both challenging and deeply rewarding. While towns nearby lit up with fireworks, I stood in awe under a sky full of stars, creating an image that felt like a celebration in its own right.
