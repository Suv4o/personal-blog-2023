# Chasing Aurora Australis on the Great Ocean Road

Lorne, along Victoria’s iconic Great Ocean Road, turned into pure magic the night the Aurora Australis lit up the sky. I woke up to see a strong aurora forecast, and without hesitation, my wife and I packed up the Nikon D800 with the trusty 17–35mm f/2.8 lens and drove straight to the coast. The night couldn’t have been better, cloudless skies, no light pollution, and unusually warm for May. Dozens of people gathered, cameras in hand, as if the whole of Melbourne had made the trip to witness nature’s rare light show. I kept shooting until I captured this panorama, stitched together from 10 images in Adobe Photoshop. It was one of those unforgettable nights when time felt suspended under the dancing southern lights.
