# Calm Night of Star Trails at Cape Schanck

Cape Schanck is usually known for its wild winds and rugged cliffs, but on this rare Friday night it was unexpectedly calm. My wife and I headed down after work, chasing the promise of a clear sky with no moonlight and minimal light pollution, perfect conditions for astrophotography. Using the stairs as leading lines in my composition, I framed the shot toward the southern sky where star trails could spin beautifully. With the help of the PhotoPills app, I planned the alignment, then captured hundreds of images on my Nikon D800 with the 17â€“35mm f/2.8. Later, I blended the shots in StarStax and polished them in Lightroom to reveal the swirling trails. Cape Schanck is stunning by day, but under the stars, it feels truly magical.
