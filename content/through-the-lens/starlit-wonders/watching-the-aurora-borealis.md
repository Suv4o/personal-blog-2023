# Under the Aurora at Aireys Inlet

Great Ocean Road is a place I’ve visited many times, but this night was different, the sky was alive with the Aurora Australis. After my aurora app showed a high index and clear skies ahead, I grabbed my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm f/2.8, packed the tripod, and my wife and I set off into the night. Even though it was late autumn, the air was warm and the shoreline was filled with people chasing the same glow. I set the camera to fire every five seconds and asked my wife to step into the frame with me, so we could capture not just the aurora, but the memory of being there together. It was one of those rare nights that felt almost impossible to repeat.
