# Stars Above Uluru

Deep in the heart of Australia’s Red Centre, Uluru rises from the desert like a giant sandstone monolith, more massive in person than any photo could ever suggest. I arrived at Kata Tjuṯa National Park before sunset and watched as the rock shifted through breathtaking shades of gold, orange, and blue. Travelers from around the world gathered to witness this natural wonder, but once the sun dipped below the horizon, the crowds dispersed, leaving me alone with the silence of the desert night. With my Nikon D7200 and Sigma 50–150mm f/2.8 zoomed all the way to 150mm, I set up my tripod and captured a series of long exposures, later blending them into this star trail image. The glow in the foreground came from my car lights, which I turned on just enough to softly illuminate the scene, a small detail that added a grounding touch to the vast sky. Standing there under the endless sky, with Uluru silhouetted beneath the stars, was a humbling reminder of just how small we are next to nature’s timeless beauty.
