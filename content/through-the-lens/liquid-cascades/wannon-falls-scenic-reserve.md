# Discovering Wannon Falls

While our initial plan was a trip to the iconic Great Ocean Road, we decided to take a spontaneous detour to Wannon Falls in Victoria. Having seen images of this unique waterfall, I was compelled to witness its beauty first hand, even though it was a couple of hours away from our base in Port Campbell. Upon arriving, I was completely taken aback, the landscape felt more like a remote, volcanic island than what I'd always pictured in Australia. We were greeted by an overcast day, which surprisingly worked to my advantage. To capture the silky, erflowing wat and bring out the vibrant greens of the moss and foliage, I used my trusted Nikon D800 with a Nikon 17-35mm lens, shooting at 17mm. I also added a polarising filter to cut reflections and a 10-stop ND filter for that long exposure effect, perfectly capturing the magic of the scene just as I had envisioned.
