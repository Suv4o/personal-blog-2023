# A Quiet Moment at Phantom Falls

Exploring Otway National Park with my wife, we stumbled upon the Phantom Falls. I was immediately drawn to the scene, not just by the waterfall, but by the logs resting in the foreground. They created a natural, leading line that perfectly complemented the smooth flow of the water. The light was piercing through the dense forest above and illuminating the scene from behind the falls. To capture this enchanting light and the silky smooth water, I relied on my trusty Nikon D800 paired with a Nikon 17-35mm lens, set at 17mm. I also used a polarising filter to cut out the reflections on the water and make the colours pop, and an ND 6-stop filter to achieve that beautiful, flowing effect on the falls.
