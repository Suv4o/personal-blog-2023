# A Panoramic View of Carrington Falls

The lush, misty landscape of Carrington Falls in New South Wales is truly a sight to behold. We visited during the end of year holidays with my wife, and as we approached the waterfall, a thick fog enveloped the valley, creating a mystical atmosphere. I knew I had to capture the entire scene, not just the falls themselves. To do this, I decided to shoot a vertical panorama with my Nikon D800 and the Nikon 17-35mm lens, set at a wide 17mm. I set the camera to take photos every five seconds, then ran all the way to a large rock on the edge of the falls. If you look closely, you can see a small figure standing there, thatâ€™s me! I took a few images to show the immense scale of the falls and the valley before heading back. I captured five separate portrait oriented images, fighting the ever present moisture in the air. Later, I stitched them together in Adobe Lightroom to bring the vast valley and the powerful, falls into a single, breathtaking frame.
