# Where the Forest Meets the Falls

Deep in the Otways along the Great Ocean Road, Hopetoun Falls feels like stepping into another world, lush ferns, mossy rocks, and the sound of water echoing through the forest. To reach the falls you first have to hike down a long series of steps, ending at a wooden boardwalk lookout that frames the waterfall perfectly. But for this shot, I wanted a wider, more immersive perspective, so I stepped off the lookout and followed the stream where the scene opened up beautifully. Using my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens at 17mm, I stitched together a panorama of six images. A polarising filter made all the difference, cutting through reflections and pulling out those vibrant greens in the leaves. It wasn’t easy lining everything up among the rocks and rushing water, but it was worth the effort to capture the depth and flow of this incredible place.
