# Standing in Awe at Sendang Gile Waterfall

On our trip to Lombok, we made our way to the breathtaking Sendang Gile Waterfall, tucked into the lush foothills of Mount Rinjani. Surrounded by thick jungle and the roar of rushing water, I searched for a composition that would capture both the power of the falls and the scale of the place. Eventually, I set my camera low by the stream, stepped into the frame, and let the red jacket do its job of standing out against the sea of greenery. Shooting with my Nikon D800 and 17â€“35mm lens at 24mm, along with a NiSi polarising circular filter and a 6-stop ND filter, I was able to smooth the water and balance the light.
