# Framing the Falls

Carrington Falls in New South Wales is one of those places that makes you stop in your tracks, the water drops dramatically into the valley below, framed by the rugged cliffs and lush greenery. During a camping trip along the NSW coast with my wife and sister over the holidays, we made a detour to see this spectacular waterfall. To capture the scale, I placed myself in the frame between two trees, letting the natural lines guide the eye straight to the falls. Shooting with my Nikon D800 and a 17â€“35mm lens at 17mm, I also used a polarising filter to cut through reflections and bring out the rich greens of the forest. The mist in the air only added to the atmosphere, making it one of my favourite shots from the trip.
