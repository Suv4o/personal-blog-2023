# Hand in Hand at Hopetoun Falls

Hopetoun Falls in Victoria’s Great Otway National Park is one of those places that feels worth every step of the steep walk down. At the bottom, a wooden boardwalk leads you to a lookout where most people stop, but I wanted something more. To capture this shot, I stepped out into the river itself, setting up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm at 17mm and a NiSi polarising filter to cut glare and bring out the rich greens around the waterfall. The frame still felt empty, so I asked my partner, now my wife, to join me in the scene. We stood hand in hand as the camera clicked every few seconds, and together we created a memory that felt as much about us as the waterfall itself.
