# Lost in the Jungle at Tiu Kelep Waterfalls

Hidden deep in the lush forests of Lombok, Indonesia, Tiu Kelep Waterfalls feels like a scene straight from the heart of the jungle. My wife and I set out on holiday to explore the island, and after a short hike through greenery, river crossings, and even a few monkeys along the way, we finally reached this waterfall. The place was alive with tourists swimming at the base, but I wanted to capture the waterfall in a way that showed its wild, untouched beauty. So I stepped back from the crowd, set up my Nikon D800 with the 24–70mm lens at 50mm, and used a circular polarizer to bring out the rich greens, along with a 10-stop ND filter for a long exposure. Not only did it smooth out the powerful flow of water, but it also erased the swimmers, leaving behind a scene that truly felt like being lost in the jungle.
