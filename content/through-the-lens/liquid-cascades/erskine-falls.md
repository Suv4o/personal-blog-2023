# Photographing the Giants of Erskine Falls

Erskine Falls is a stunning waterfall tucked away in the Otways, a lush, verdant rainforest in Victoria, Australia. When my wife and I visited on a Saturday trip, a group of influencers were already there, posing for photos right beneath the waterfall. They were completely drenched but committed to getting the shot, and I thought their dedication made for a unique scene. I knew I had to capture it, so I carefully navigated down the slippery path from the lookout to get a closer vantage point. To cut through the glare and slow down the water's movement, I used an ND 6 filter and a polarising filter on my Nikon D800 with the Nikon 17-35mm lens. I took a vertical panorama at 17mm to emphasize the sheer height of the falls and the person at its base, creating a sense of scale and wonder.
