# Through the Ferns to the Falls

Hidden deep in Victoria’s Great Otway National Park, Beauchamp Falls is one of those places where nature feels untouched. I visited this spot with my wife, and standing at the base of the waterfall, I was struck by the way the light filtered through the tall trees, spilling over the rushing water and lighting up the ferns in a soft glow. I wanted to capture both the calm and the movement, so I set up my Nikon D800 with the Nikon 17–35mm lens at 17mm. To bring out the detail in the rocks and cut through the glare of the water, I used a NiSi polarising filter, and to smooth the flow I added a 6-stop ND filter. The mist and spray from the falls kept covering my filter with drops, and I had to keep wiping it and re-taking the shot, but it was worth the effort.
