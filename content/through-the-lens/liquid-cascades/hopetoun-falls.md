# Where the Forest Meets the Falls

Deep in the Otways along the Great Ocean Road, Hopetoun Falls feels like a hidden world of vibrant ferns, mossy rocks, and the constant roar of water echoing through the forest. The journey down takes you along a long staircase that finally opens onto a wooden boardwalk lookout, perfectly framing the falls. This time, I stayed at the lookout, letting the scene speak for itself, the waterfall standing alone, surrounded by a wall of greenery. I shot it with my Nikon D800 and a 24–70mm lens set at 24mm, using a polarising filter to cut the glare and make the greens come alive. It was one of those moments where patience and the right perspective made all the difference.
