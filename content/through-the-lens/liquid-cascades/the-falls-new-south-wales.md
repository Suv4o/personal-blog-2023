# Hidden Gem at The Falls, NSW

Tucked away in New South Wales, The Falls is one of those hidden gems you won’t find crowded with tourists. While camping with my wife near Batemans Bay, I stumbled across this spot on Google and knew I had to see it in person. When I arrived, the waterfall was flowing gently, and I felt the scene needed a little extra perspective, so I stepped into the frame myself. My red jacket turned out to be the perfect contrast against the muted tones of the rocks and water. Captured with my Nikon and a 24–70mm lens at 50mm, along with a polarising filter to cut reflections and make the colours pop, this shot feels like a reminder of why I love chasing these off-the-beaten-path places.
