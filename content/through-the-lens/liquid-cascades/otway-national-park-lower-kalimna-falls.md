# Ferns and Falls

Hidden deep within the lush rainforest of Otway National Park lies the Lower Kalimna Falls. Before we welcomed our daughter, my wife and I had a Saturday tradition of exploring these kinds of spots. This specific waterfall had been on my list for a while, and the journey to it was a beautiful, steady walk. When we arrived, the scene was even more stunning than I had imagined. I instantly noticed how the ferns could be used to frame the shot, creating a beautiful foreground, and the way the sunbeam cut through the canopy added a perfect atmosphere. To capture that dreamy, soft flow of the water, I used my Nikon D800 with the Nikon 17-35mm lens, adding a polarising filter to cut the glare and make the greenery pop, and a 6-stop ND filter to turn the waterfall into a smooth, liquid ribbon.
