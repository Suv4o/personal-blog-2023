# Long Exposure at Toorongo Falls

Standing on the wooden lookout platform at Toorongo Falls feels like stepping into a lush, green painting. After a moderate hike to get there, with a few steep bits that definitely got the heart pumping, the view was more than worth it. I wanted to capture the sheer power and beauty of the waterfall, but I also wanted to add a personal touch to the frame. By walking through the scene, I created a bit of motion blur, and my red jacket really popped against all the green, adding a dynamic contrast. The whole scene was captured with my trusty Nikon D800 and the Nikon 17-35mm lens at 17mm. To get that silky smooth water effect, I stacked a circular polarising filter to cut the glare and a 6-stop ND filter for a longer exposure.
