# Broken Jetty Reflections at Kororoit Creek

Kororoit Creek in Victoria has a quiet charm, and what really drew me here was an old, broken jetty I had seen pop up in a few photographers’ feeds. I’ve always had a soft spot for jetties, so I decided this was the one I had to capture. What struck me most were the uneven, weathered beams that gave the scene so much character. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens set at 17mm, I added a polarising filter and my trusty 10-stop ND filter to smooth out the water and bring movement into the sky. I was lucky with the colours that evening, the stillness of the creek mirrored the soft tones above, creating a calm and almost optimistic atmosphere.
