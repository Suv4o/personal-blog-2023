# Ocean Glow at Cape Woolamai

Magiclands Steps at Cape Woolamai is a spot you might easily pass on the way to Pinnacles Lookout, but for me it turned out to be the real highlight. My wife and I had set out to capture the sunset at the Pinnacles, only to find the clouds weren’t shaping up for anything dramatic. On our walk back, the steps caught my eye just as the sun broke through, casting a golden glow over the beach. A group of teenagers ran across the sand, adding a burst of energy that gave the scene life. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, I set up quickly and captured the moment, proof that sometimes the best images come when you least expect them.
