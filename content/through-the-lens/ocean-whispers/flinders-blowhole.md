# Rainbow Over Flinders Blowhole

At the rugged Flinders Blowhole on the Mornington Peninsula, me and my wife arrived just before sunset as a light rain began to fall. The tide was so low that the rocks stretched endlessly, dotted with small pools glowing with green seaweed that immediately caught my eye. I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm on a tripod, framing the textures of the rocks and seaweed in the foreground, but something still felt missing. That’s when I asked my wife to join me in the shot, standing hand in hand against the dramatic coastline. Just as we got into place, a rainbow arched across the sky, the perfect finishing touch to a scene that felt both raw and magical.
