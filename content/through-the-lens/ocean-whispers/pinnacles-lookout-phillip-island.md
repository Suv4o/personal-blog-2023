# Wild Seas at Pinnacles Lookout

Pinnacles Lookout on Cape Woolamai is one of Phillip Island’s most dramatic coastal viewpoints, with jagged rock formations rising from the wild Southern Ocean. On my last day of a weekend trip with friends, we hiked the trail from Cape Woolamai Surf Beach, bracing against strong winds as waves crashed furiously below. Setting up my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm lens, I held tightly to my tripod so it wouldn’t blow over and snapped six frames, later stitching them into this panoramic shot. No filters, just raw ocean energy and a memory of battling the wind to capture nature’s raw beauty.
