# Sunrise Whispers at Loch Ard Gorge

Loch Ard Gorge, along Victoria’s iconic Great Ocean Road, is a place where rugged cliffs meet the restless sea. On my last morning there, I set out before sunrise determined to capture one final shot, even though the wind was fierce and my tripod shook with every gust. I fitted a circular polarising filter onto my Nikon D800 and framed the scene through my 17–35mm lens, pressing the shutter again and again, hoping to steady the moment against the breeze. The challenge made the capture unforgettable, every time I look at this image, I remember the sound of the wind rushing through the gorge and the patience it demanded.
