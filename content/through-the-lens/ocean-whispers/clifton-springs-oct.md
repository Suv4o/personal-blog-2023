# The Forgotten Pier of Clifton Springs

Clifton Springs, a small coastal town near Geelong, is home to the remains of an old jetty that now stands as weathered pillars rising from the bay. I was drawn to this scene for its simplicity, choosing a low, wide-angle perspective to emphasise the lines and depth of the structure. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, I used a polarising filter to bring out the colours and reduce glare, while an ND filter smoothed the waves into a soft, dreamy texture. At first, the nearly clear sky made me think the shot wouldn’t work, but the few clouds on the horizon added just enough balance. If you ever visit this spot, make sure you time it with low tide, that’s the only way to capture this unique angle.
