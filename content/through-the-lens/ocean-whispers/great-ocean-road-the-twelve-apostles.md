# Sunset Glory on the Great Ocean Road

Along Victoria’s Great Ocean Road, the Twelve Apostles rise dramatically from the Southern Ocean, their limestone pillars shaped by centuries of wind and waves. On this evening, the sky lit up with fiery shades of pink and orange, contrasting beautifully against the dark storm clouds drifting in from the horizon. I had my Nikon D5200 with a 50mm lens set up on a tripod, keeping things simple without filters. Standing there with the roar of the waves below and the cliffs glowing in the last light, I was reminded that sometimes it’s not about the equipment at all, it’s about being present for the moment when everything comes together.
