# Lost in the Scale

Glasshouse Rocks at Knickers Beach in Narooma is one of those places that feels like stepping back in time, jagged volcanic formations rising out of the sea, shaped over millions of years. I discovered it with my wife and our little dog April on a Christmas road trip near Batemans Bay, and couldn’t resist trying to capture the sense of scale. To show just how massive these rocks really are, I set my Nikon D800 on a tripod, framed the shot at 70mm with my 24–70mm lens, and used a circular polariser to cut glare and bring out the colors in the sky. With the self-timer clicking away every three seconds, I stepped into the frame myself, and standing beside those towering rocks, I felt both small and amazed.
