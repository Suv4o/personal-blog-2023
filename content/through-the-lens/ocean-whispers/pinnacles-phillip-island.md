# Sunset Rays at the Pinnacles, Phillip Island

The Pinnacles Lookout at Cape Woolamai, Phillip Island, is one of those places where nature feels both raw and peaceful at the same time. My friend and I set out to photograph the sunset, first stopping at the lookout platform with its bench and sweeping views, before deciding to take on the steep track that winds down to the base of the Pinnacles. It’s not an easy path, and I’d recommend only going down with company and while there’s still plenty of daylight, as the climb back can be tough. That afternoon, we scrambled over rocks and found a spot to settle in, enjoying the ocean breeze while I set up my Nikon D7200 with a Sigma 18–35mm lens. As the sun dropped lower, a perfect ray of light broke through the Pinnacles and landed on my lens, something that only happens at this time of year. A few weeks later, and I would have missed it entirely.
