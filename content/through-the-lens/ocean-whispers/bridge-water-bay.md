# Surreal Waves at Low Tide

<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7UNxnWYhnvNvEu1z5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Google Maps</a>

Bridgewater Bay in Victoria is known for its rugged rock formations and shallow tidal pools, but this spot is only reachable at very low tide. I captured this surreal scene standing in shallow water that made it feel like I was inside the ocean itself, though I wasn’t. The rolling waves stretched through and behind me, and with a long exposure they created that dreamy, streaked effect across the frame. I used my Nikon D800 paired with a 17–35mm lens, along with a polarising filter and a 6-stop ND filter to cut reflections and slow down the water’s movement. Sadly, the arch you see here has since been damaged, making this composition no longer possible, which makes this shot feel even more special.
