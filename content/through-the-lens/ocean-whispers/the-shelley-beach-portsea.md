# A Peaceful Moment on the Wooden Jetty

Shelley Beach in Portsea, Victoria, is dotted with charming wooden jetties, each offering its own unique view of the ocean. I had photographed nearly all the others, but this final zig-zag jetty immediately caught my eye, especially as waves reached all the way to its end at high tide. The overcast weather set a soft, muted mood, and when a brief rain gave the wood a wet sheen, I knew I had to capture it. I popped on my 10-stop ND filter to smooth the waves and used a polarising filter to cut reflections, shooting with my Nikon D800 and 24-70mm lens set at 35mm. The result felt calm, peaceful, and cinematic, a perfect moment frozen in time.
