# Pastel Skies Over Dragon Head

Dragon Head on the Mornington Peninsula is one of those places that feels almost mythical, a rock formation that, from just the right angle, looks exactly like a dragon’s head rising from the sea. To capture it, timing is everything, at high tide the rock disappears completely under water, so I planned my visit around the lowest tide that also aligned with sunset. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, I used a polarising filter to cut the glare and an ND filter to smooth out the water. As the light shifted, the dragon-shaped rock was beautifully lit from the side behind me, giving it extra depth and definition. The sky opposite the setting sun lit up in soft pastel pinks and blues, creating the perfect backdrop. I stayed until blue hour, making the most of that fleeting light to bring out the mood of this unique spot.
