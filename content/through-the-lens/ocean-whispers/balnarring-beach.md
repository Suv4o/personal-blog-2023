# When the Tide Meets the Jetty

<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FcW2Vqsx5Nvfuzrn6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Google Maps</a>

Balnarring Beach, tucked along Victoria’s coastline, is home to a unique wooden zig-zag jetty that feels almost alive when the tide is high. When I arrived before sunset, the sky was covered with thick clouds, and I thought the light might be gone for good. But as the approaching sunset drew closer, most of the heavy clouds drifted away, leaving a mix of high and low clouds that caught the sun behind me and glowed with purple and pink tones. I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17-35mm lens at 17mm and used a 6-stop ND filter for a long exposure, which smoothed out the waves as they rolled into the jetty. If you visit this spot, make sure you time it with very high tide, otherwise, the jetty sits completely out of the water and the magic of the scene is lost.
