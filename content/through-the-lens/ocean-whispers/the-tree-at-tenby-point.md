# The Lonely Tree at Tenby Point

Tenby Point in Victoria, Australia, is known for its famous Lonely Tree, a solitary figure rising from the tidal waters and a true magnet for photographers. I had been waiting for the right conditions to capture it, and this time I arrived at mid-tide so the tree stood mostly above the water. The day began sunny, but as sunset approached, high clouds drifted in and caught the light beautifully. Using my Nikon D800 with the 24â€“70mm lens and a 10-stop ND filter, I created a long exposure that transformed the clouds into streaks of colour. Framing the tree off to the right, I let the open sky balance the composition and emphasize its solitude against the glowing clouds.
