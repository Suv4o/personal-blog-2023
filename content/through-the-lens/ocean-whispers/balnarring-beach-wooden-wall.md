# Wooden Guardians of Balnarring Beach

Balnarring Beach in Victoria has these mysterious wooden fences standing quietly against the tides, and I’ve always found them striking through the lens. To capture them at their best, I timed my visit with high tide, which luckily aligned with a warm, glowing sunset. I slipped off my shoes, waded into the water, and set up my Nikon D800 with the 17–35mm lens. With a polarising filter to cut reflections and a 10-stop ND filter for a long exposure, the sea turned silky smooth and the high clouds caught soft sunset hues. Placing the fence off to the left created a guiding line into the horizon, while the fading light gave the wood rich texture and depth. It was one of those moments where planning and patience came together beautifully.
