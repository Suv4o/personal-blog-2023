# Calm Between the Beach Boxes

Hawker Beach in Mount Martha, on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, is one of those spots where the beach boxes seem to float right on the water when the tide is high. I arrived on an overcast afternoon with little expectation, but the timing was perfect for a long exposure as the tide rolled in. Nestled between two of the bathing boxes, I set up my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens, using a NiSi circular polariser to bring out subtle tones and a 6-stop ND filter to smooth both the waves and the shifting clouds. As the sky slowly began to clear, soft rays of sun hinted at breaking through, and the result was a calm, silken scene where the ocean almost seemed to breathe.
