# Silent Boat Under a Hazy Sun

Elwood Beach in Victoria is usually known for its lively shoreline and wide horizon views, but on this day in 2019 the air was thick with smoke from nearby fires, turning the sun into a muted, almost surreal glow. I had originally set out to photograph the sunset from the Point Ormond lookout, but nothing worked out. On the walk back, I spotted this lone boat perfectly aligned with the hazy sun. I quickly set up my Nikon D800 with the 70â€“200mm lens zoomed all the way in to 200mm, mounted it on a tripod to keep the shot steady, and slowed the shutter for the best exposure. What started as an unplanned moment turned into one of my favourite captures, the boat becoming the quiet hero of the smoky seascape.
