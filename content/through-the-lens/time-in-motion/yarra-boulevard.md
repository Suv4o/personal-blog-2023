# Leading Lines to the Melbourne CBD

Yarra Boulevard in Melbourne offers hidden vantage points with stunning views of the city skyline. I chose this spot to capture the bridge crossing the Eastern Freeway, with the CBD glowing in the distance. Planning for a weekday sunset meant plenty of cars streaming home from work, and I used a long exposure to turn their lights into dynamic leading lines that guide the eye toward the city. To stretch the exposure even further, I added an ND filter, creating a smooth, flowing effect even without dramatic skies. I shot this with my Nikon D800 paired with the 17-35mm lens, and the results felt both vibrant and alive.
