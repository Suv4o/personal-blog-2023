# Clouds Over Point Ormond

Point Ormond Lookout in Elwood is a small hill by the beach, a favourite spot for locals and tourists who gather on warm evenings to watch the city skyline at sunset. I’ve photographed this view many times, but on this occasion, I wanted to try something different. Instead of focusing on the city, I framed the wooden structure in the middle of the hill as my subject. Setting up beneath it, I stayed perfectly still for a 30-second exposure to let the fast-moving clouds paint streaks across the sky. With the help of a 6-stop ND filter, my Nikon D800 paired with a 17–35mm lens captured the sense of motion beautifully, turning an ordinary scene into something more timeless.
