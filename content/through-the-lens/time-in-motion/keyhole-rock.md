# Keyhole Rock at Bridgewater Bay

Bridgewater Bay’s Keyhole Rock is a striking formation that’s now unfortunately damaged by the shifting waters, making this moment impossible to recreate. I headed there at sunset, timing my visit for high tide to frame the rock perfectly amid the water’s movement. Using my Nikon D800 with the 17-35mm at 17mm and a circular polarising filter, I set the aperture to f/16 to slow the light and capture the flowing water weaving between the rocks. It felt rewarding to preserve this fleeting scene before the landscape changed forever.
