# Pastel Waves at Balnarring Beach

Balnarring Beach on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula is known for its wide sandy stretch, dog-friendly atmosphere, and the wooden fences that line parts of the shoreline. I’ve photographed here many times, but for this shot I waited for high tide so the barriers were partly submerged, creating a striking contrast with the moving water. Using my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens, I added a polarising filter and a 6-stop ND filter to smooth the waves into soft motion and draw the eye along the fence toward the horizon. The pastel tones in the sky and sea brought everything together, giving the scene a calm, almost timeless feel.
