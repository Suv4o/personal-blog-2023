# Zig-Zag Old Jetty at Balnarring

Balnarring Beach in Victoria is home to a charming wooden zig-zag jetty at its far end, a spot that works best for photography at high tide. I arrived before sunset, hoping for golden light, but the sun was already hidden behind thick clouds. Instead of giving up, I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17-35mm at 17mm wide open and added a 10-stop ND filter to capture the gentle movement of the waves and clouds. The long exposure revealed soft, dreamy pastel colors across the sky, and the scene felt serene despite the challenging light. Timing this location with high tide makes all the difference, the jetty almost floats on the water, adding a graceful rhythm to the composition.
