# Bitola from Above

Gazing out over my hometown of Bitola, North Macedonia, the view from the Church of St. Michael the Archangel is absolutely breathtaking. Getting here wasn't easy, the unpaved road was a bumpy ride, but it was worth it for the 360-degree panorama of the city below. I chose this specific perspective because the winding road acts as a natural leading line, drawing your eye towards the mountains of Pelister National Park. Staying past sunset allowed the city lights to create another layer of dimension, and using my Nikon D800 with a Nikon 17-35mm lens, I was able to capture the car trails as glowing, ethereal lines. The addition of a 6-stop ND filter helped make the light trails even smoother and more prominent, turning the motion of the cars into streaks of light and adding a dynamic element to the quiet scene.
