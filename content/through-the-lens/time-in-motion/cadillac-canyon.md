# Cadillac Canyon at Sunset

At the far end of Bore Beach in Victoria, Australia, lies a dramatic spot known among photographers as Cadillac Canyon, a rocky formation where waves crash with incredible force into a narrow channel. I had heard about this place many times and finally decided to experience it for myself. Standing on the rocks as the tide surged around me was both thrilling and a little unnerving, but it was the only way to capture the scene the way I imagined it. I set up my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens and used a 6-stop ND filter to smooth out the water, shooting a long exposure as the sun set. Holding still while the waves pounded nearby wasn’t easy, but the result was worth every second of tension.
