# Lonely Tree at Tenby Point

Tenby Point in Victoria is home to the iconic Lonely Tree, a favourite among photographers who chase the perfect composition. I had been trying to capture it for some time and finally timed my visit for mid-tide, just right to keep the tree mostly above the water. The day was overcast, and clouds had already taken over the sky, but instead of giving up, I set up my Nikon D800 with the 17â€“35mm lens and added a 10-stop ND filter. This allowed me to blur the moving clouds, creating a dramatic effect and a smooth reflection of the tree and nearby bush in the water, highlighting the quiet atmosphere of the scene.
