# Dramatic Skies Over Mordialloc Beach

This old jetty at Mordialloc Beach standing worn and weathered as if each tide takes a little more of it away. I planned this shot carefully, waiting for high tide so the jetty would sit just right in the frame. The evening brought shifting skies, bursts of rain, heavy winds, and then a dramatic sunset that painted one side in fiery light while clouds gathered on the other. The crashing waves added even more drama, making the scene come alive through the lens. I captured it with my Nikon D800 paired with a 17–35mm lens at its widest, using a NiSi circular polariser to cut glare and a 6-stop ND filter to bring motion into the water. By the time I packed up, the light had already shifted and the drama was gone.
