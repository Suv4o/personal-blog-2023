# Time in Motion Over Melbourne

Standing on the William Barak Bridge, one of Melbourne’s pedestrian walkways leading toward the MCG, I found the perfect vantage point to capture the rhythm of the city. From here, trains stream out of Richmond Station toward Flinders Street and the city loop, forming a corridor that feels alive during rush hour. I first spotted this view while walking across the bridge one day, imagining how incredible it would look with the blur of trains against the skyline. So, I returned at blue hour, when the office lights glowed and the sky still carried hints of color, setting up my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens. The long exposure turned the constant rush of trains into vibrant light trails, pulling the viewer’s eye straight into the heart of Melbourne.
