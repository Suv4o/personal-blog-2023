# Melbourne City Lights

From the William Barak Bridge, Melbourne’s skyline comes alive as the workday winds down. I wanted to capture that energy along Batman Avenue, where cars streamed past in glowing trails against the backdrop of illuminated office towers. Shooting midweek meant the buildings were fully lit, something you don’t always see on weekends. With my Nikon D800 and 17–35mm lens, I used both a circular polarizer and a 6-stop ND filter to extend the exposure, softening the movement in the clouds and stretching the car light trails into vibrant strokes across the city.
