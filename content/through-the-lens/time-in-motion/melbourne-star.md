# When the Wheel Turned in Docklands

The Melbourne Star once lit up Docklands with its slow, graceful rotations, and in 2015 I found the perfect vantage point from the top of a car park that no longer exists. After my last class at Uni in the CBD, I grabbed my Nikon D7200 and Sigma 18–35mm lens, jumped on a tram, and headed straight here. The rain had just cleared, leaving behind a moody blue hour sky. As the wheel turned and clouds drifted across, I set up a long exposure to capture both in motion, no filters needed. Looking back now, with the Melbourne Star closed and the car park gone, this photo feels like a snapshot of time itself, a memory of my student days and a city moment that can’t be repeated.
