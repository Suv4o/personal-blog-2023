# Exploring Glasshouse Rocks at Knickers Beach

Knickers Beach in Narooma, New South Wales, is home to striking volcanic rock formations known as the Glasshouse Rocks. During a Christmas road trip near Batemans Bay, my wife, our little dog April, and I stumbled upon this hidden gem while exploring the coastline. After a short hike along the sand, I stepped barefoot into the water, unsure how to frame the perfect shot. Using my Nikon D800 with the 17-35mm at 17mm, I added a 6-stop ND filter and a circular polariser to capture the smooth motion of the waves and cut reflections. With the sun high in the sky, I played with composition, placing the central rock and using two others as leading lines, to turn an ordinary midday scene into something dramatic. It was a rewarding challenge, and I can only imagine how magical it would look at sunset.
