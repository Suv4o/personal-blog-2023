# Sunset in Motion at Flinders Street Station

Flinders Street Railway Station is one of Melbourne’s most iconic landmarks, but capturing it like this was a once-in-a-lifetime shot. I set up on a tiny island in the middle of the road that no longer exists, balancing my tripod legs out into the street while curious passersby stopped to watch. Even the tram driver on the City Circle line had a laugh, calling out when he saw I was still standing there after an hour. Using my Nikon D800 with a 17–35mm lens, along with a polarising filter and a 10-stop ND filter, I managed to capture the movement of city lights and drifting clouds in a long exposure. The reflected glow from a nearby skyscraper lit up the station’s facade just as the sun dropped, giving the scene a unique warmth I’ll probably never be able to recreate.
