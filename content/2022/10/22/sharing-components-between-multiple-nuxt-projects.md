Nuxt 3 and its new foundation come with many powerful new features, such as the new server engine [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine/) that made the framework lighter and faster and supported by Vue's 3 Composition API and Vite.

But one of Nuxt's features that not many people talk about is the ability to merge two or more applications and share functionalities between them. The [extends](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration/nuxt-config/#extends) feature in Nuxt 3 allows us to set a relative config path or remote git repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or https:// pointing to the source directories of a project.

This feature is a perfect use case for complex projects such us developing applications with a few different pieces, for example, an Admin and a User area that are designed separately but share the same components.

Let's see how this works with an example.

## Setting up a base Nuxt 3 project

Create a new Nuxt project:

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt-base
```

Navigate to the `nuxt-base` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd nuxt-base
npm install
```

We will come back to this project a bit later. Next, let's create the other Nuxt project `nuxt-components`.

## Setting up a second Nuxt 3 project

Let's repeat what we've done previously with the new project.

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt-components
cd nuxt-components
npm install
```

We should create both projects in the same folder:

```plain
/root
	/nuxt-base
		app.vue
		nuxt.config.ts
		package.json
		...
	/nuxt-components
		app.vue
		nuxt.config.ts
		package.json
		...
```

We will create a directory called components in the root of the `nuxt-components` project. Inside we will add two `.vue` files:

`random-message.vue` containing the following code:

```js
<template>
    <div>
        <h1>{{ msg }}</h1>
        <button @click="changeMsg">Generate a Message</button>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";
const msg = ref("");
const changeMsg = () => {
    msg.value = makeid(getRandomInt(100));
};

function makeid(length) {
    var result = "";
    var characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
    var charactersLength = characters.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersLength));
    }
    return result;
}

function getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}
</script>
```

And `random-word.vue` containing the following code:

```js
<template>
    <div>
        <h1>{{ word }}</h1>
        <button @click="generateRandomWord">Generate a Word</button>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";
import randomWords from "random-words";

const word = ref("");

function generateRandomWord() {
    word.value = randomWords();
}
</script>
```

We also need to install the `random-word` npm package so let's do it:

```bash
npm install random-words
```

The idea with these two components we just created above is to use them in our `nuxt-base` project.

Before we move to the `next-base` project again, let's add configuration in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    components: [{ path: "./components", prefix: "UI" }],
});
```

We added a prefix `UI` to all components in the `/components` directory. We can use these two components like this:

```ts
<UIRandomMessage />
<UIRandomWord />
```

## Adding `random-message.vue` and `random-word.vue` to the `nuxt-base` project

In the `app.vue` file inside the `nuxt-base` project, we will use `random-message.vue` and `random-word.vue` components.

Our `app.vue` file should look like the following:

```js
<template>
    <div>
        <UIRandomMessage />
        <UIRandomWord />
    </div>
</template>
```

Next, we need to tell Nuxt that we want to extend our `nuxt-base` project with `nuxt-components`. We can do so by adding the following in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    components: true,
    extends: ["../nuxt-components"],
});
```

And that's it. We can run our application and see two components in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Generate static site

Our application works as expected, running locally on our dev server. However, there is one problem if we try to generate statically. If we run `npm run generate`, we will get the following error:

```bash
ERROR  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "vue/server-renderer" from "../nuxt-components/components/random-message.vue".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
```

To fix this issue, we need to create a `vite.config.ts` file in the root of our `nuxt-base` project and add the following code:

```bash
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
    build: {
        rollupOptions: {
            external: ["vue/server-renderer"],
        },
    },
});
```

That's it. Now we can generate our `nuxt-base` app without any problems.

All examples above can be found in the following Github repositories: [`nuxt-base`](https://github.com/Suv4o/nuxt-extends-example), [`nuxt-components`](https://github.com/Suv4o/nuxt-component-generate-message).

## Conclusion

1. One of Nuxt's features that not many people talk about is the ability to merge two or more applications and share functionalities between them. A perfect use case will be designing an Admin and a User area that are developed separately but share the same components.
2. We can merge multiple projects by using the [extends](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration/nuxt-config/#extends) feature in Nuxt 3.
3. The extends feature allows us to set a relative config path or remote git repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or https:// pointing to the source directories of a project.
4. To use another project inside our Nuxt app, we need to include the project’s path in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.
5. To generate our project statically, we need to add `"vue/server-renderer"` to our `vite.config.ts` file.
