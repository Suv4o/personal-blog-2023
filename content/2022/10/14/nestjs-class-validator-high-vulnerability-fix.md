title: Nest.js class-validator high vulnerability fix
description: If you have used Nest.js recently probably have realised that the class-validator library has a high vulnerability in it, which is not being addressed for quite a while. The ValidationPipe makes use of the powerful class-validator package and its declarative validation decorators. The ValidationPipe provides a convenient approach to enforce validation rules for all incoming client payloads, where the specific rules are declared with simple annotations in local class/DTO declarations in each module. The class-validator package works in conjunction with another package class-transformer. The lack of maintenance made the Nuxt team fork the original packages and take care of the maintenance.

If you have used Nest.js recently, you probably have realised that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-validator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`class-validator`</a> library has a high vulnerability in it, which has not been addressed for quite a while.

The <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`ValidationPipe`</a> uses the powerful `class-validator` package and its declarative validation decorators. The `ValidationPipe` provides a convenient approach to enforce validation rules for all incoming client payloads. The specific rules are declared with simple annotations in each module's local class/DTO declarations.

The `class-validator` package works in conjunction with another package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-transformer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`class-transformer`</a>. The lack of maintenance made the Nuxt team fork the original packages and took care of the maintenance.

## **How to migrate to the new forked packages**

1. Uninstall the existing `class-validator` and `class-transformer` packages from the Nest project.

```bash
npm uninstall class-validator class-transformer
```

1. Install the newly forked packages.

```bash
npm install @nestjs/class-validator @nestjs/class-transformer
```

1. In the `main.ts` file, add the following:

```ts
app.useGlobalPipes(
    new ValidationPipe({
        validatorPackage: require("@nestjs/class-validator"),
        transformerPackage: require("@nestjs/class-transformer"),
    })
);
```

And that's all! Now we can start using the newly maintained packages.

## Conclusion

This solution is a workaround for the time being until the Nest team figures out what is the best approach to migrate in the future.
